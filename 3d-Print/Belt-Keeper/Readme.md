# Belt-Keeper

The Belt-Keeper holds the belds in place while you can unscrew the TH from the carriage.
The belts do not need to be relieved or readjusted.

## Assembly

To understand how it works you can print the parts and test them with a smal belt.

|||
|---|---|
| You need Belt_Keeper-A, Belt-Keeper-B and 4x Belt_Keeper-Insert|<img width="256px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a2c7773-d87f-473e-aa31-2083badd60b5" /> 
| The teeth of the belt must lie neatly in the recesses of the belt keeper and then the trapezoidal catch, which is designed to be a little tight, must be secured. | <img width="256px" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b7d4b89-b4b5-4fb5-bf42-6a32643e563a" /> 

## Please note

- ### Before you consider installing the Belt-Keeper in your printer, remember that the belts have to be shortened! 
- ### You should also consider whether the protruding ends restrict the printing area of your printer!
- ### Do a pull test to see if the belt keeper could break or if the belts could slip out.
